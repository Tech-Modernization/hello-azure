# hello-azure

Learn Azure through this dumb web app! I built this while trying to get my Azure certs (and so I can
convince myself that Azure actually isn't that bad.)

## The app

A simple Flask app that gives you a cute picture and a counter of how many times you clicked the
button.

## `v0`: Nothin' but IaaS

Deployment details coming soon.
