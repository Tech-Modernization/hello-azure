# Storage

- Azure Blob Storage is the equivalent of AWS S3.

# Testing

- Azurite is Microsoft's equivalent of `localstack`

# #random

- A bit of a shame that Microsoft created Azurite instead of the community
- This feels awfully reminiscent of my experience using Terraform's Azure provider.
  Mostly maintained by Microsoft, i.e. the community is still allergic to az.
